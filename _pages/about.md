# About Me
![My Photo](../assets/images/jolsa.png)
I am a graduate student at Seoul National University ([SNU](https://en.snu.ac.kr/)), advised by Prof. [Kyogu Lee](https://marg.snu.ac.kr/63b16fe3-365b-4a56-b970-1b3ec2839470). I received a B.S. degree in Applied Artificial Intelligence at Sungkyunkwan University. I am currently interested in Music AI and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). My research goal is to enrich how people enjoy and connect with music by merging the emotional depth of music and the possibilities of AI.
